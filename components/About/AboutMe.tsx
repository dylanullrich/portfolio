            I am a Veteran with an Active Secret Clearance, and recent
            experience working in Business Development at a tech startup. While
            there, I found myself increasingly interested in streamlining and
            automating processes. I realized that I loved the thinking that went
            into integrating information from multiple platforms, which lead me
            back to the world of coding.
            <br />
            <br />I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Law, Economics, and Public
            Policy from University of Washington in March 2022, and since then I
            have devoted my time to honing my skills as a Software Developer.
